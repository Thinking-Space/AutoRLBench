# Issue verifier

This verifier grades `$AUTORLBENCH_RESULTS/agent_answer.md` against hidden
`evaluations/issue/oracle.md` with an LLM judge (`judge.py` +
`judge_prompt.md`).

The judge scores verdict, root-cause, and evidence agreement. As implemented
in `judge.py` (shared verbatim with the other tasks), a run passes only if
`verdict_score == 1.0`, `root_cause_score > 0.8` and `evidence_score > 0.8`;
the weighted score (0.2 / 0.6 / 0.2) is reported in `result.json` but does not
decide the pass. The gold
verdict for this task is `unhealthy`; the essential root cause is that
`verl/utils/reward_score/math_verify.py::compute_score` relies on
math-verify's signal-based timeout, which raises when the reward loop calls it
from a worker thread, and its bare `except Exception: pass` turns that into a
zero reward for every MATH sample.

`gold.yaml` is retained as a reviewer-facing reference. Machine grading
reads `oracle.md`, not `gold.yaml`.

Requires `AUTORLBENCH_JUDGE_MODEL`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
The output is written to `$AUTORLBENCH_RESULTS/result.json`.
